# BwE Virus Total Context Scanner

Basically a quick and easy Virus Total scanner which creates a context menu item within Windows. Compiled for x64.

You need the Virus Total API key for it to run. Register for free at https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us/ to get one.

This program needs to be run as administrator in order to store your API key in the registry and create the context menu item.

Proudly made entirely in Perl <3
